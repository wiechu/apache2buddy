2017-03-28 	Richard Forth   Small bug fix.
2017-03-25 	Richard Forth   Improved regex around the vhost count, specifically
				when looking for "port" it was capturing

				support.mydomain.com, the regex should filter out what
				we dont want to see and only give us a true count of
				vhosts. Closes #160.

				Specifically where vhost count is greater than

				do the job I wanted, also removed another 
				'privado' word I found, as this is now
				obsolete.
2017-03-25 	Richard Forth   Minor formatting issue in vhost breakdowns.
				Specifically removed extra space before
				variable in output.

				without affecting the system locale, closes
				#144
2017-03-07 	Richard Forth   Added Verbose message to start of PHP Fatal
				Checks, Closes #139
2017-02-28 	Richard Forth   Added en_AU to locale Preflight Check, Closes #137

				at the top of the file, rather than in output.

				error messaging around the parent PID, if the
				script exists because it is greater than 50MB
				- addresses issue #110
2017-02-03 	Richard Forth   Changed the logo for a more subtle and
				professional, simple, and clean look.
2017-01-28 	Richard Forth   Fixed #102 rpm error on ubuntu systems.
				- hardcoded "MySQL" in to detection string rather than
				adding lines and lines of unnecessary code trying to
				get the actual MySQL variant. I decided it wasnt that
				important to warrant the extra payload trying to
				ascertain the right OS.
				 - this change backs out the fix used to address issue
				#62 (MariaDB incorrectly identified as MySQL).
2017-01-28 	Richard Forth   Fixed #103 Spelling mistake.

2017-01-19 	Richard Forth   Fixed #82 bug with calculations displaying wrong
				colours
2017-01-14 	Richard Forth   Updated logo

				arrows in the report
				- Fixed the #66 issue regarding extraneous
				information in --report output
				- Fixed futher issues relating to the #66 issue

					- /usr/local/apache2/logs
				Will silently continue if these folders dont
				exist.
				- Addressed Issue with wonky arrows, still
				not happy with it though, columns are out of
				whack. #OCD, will raise issue and work it
				proper.

-----

The copyright line reads as my name, because I did a lot of work in making
this fork a whole new beast, and the previous project was never distributed
under any official license, I did get the blessing from Gus Maskowitz to
publish it under the Apache License 2.0.

The purpose of the license is to ensure that free software remains free, not
as in "free beer" but in "freedom". The freedom to derive new software from
this and to keep that software "free" too. 

But it is important to acknowldege too, that this is a derivative work from 
apachebuddy.pl. Even though it is not being maintained any more, I would like 
to acknowledge the talents of a few people:

Major Hayden - for his inspiring work on MySQLTuner.pl
Jacob Walcik - who is the credited author of apachebuddy.pl (see the first
few lines of the original script code at http:// apachebuddy.pl)
Gus Maskowitz - for his work on the script, though it is no longer maintained
Will Parsons - for hosting the original script at http://apachebuddy.pl

Here I note that I also do not maintain the old project, this is a complete
fork and revamp of the original code, and is maintained separately.

These credits will remain and will, in time, be embedded into the code of the
original script as a mark of respect for the heritage of this code.

Please keep any and all credits in the source code, and if you derive a new
software from it, by all means add your own credits.

2016-05-24 	Richard Forth   Added INFO ITEM about sha256sums.
2016-05-24 	Richard Forth   Added sha256sums => 
				http://apache2buddy.pl/sha256sums.txt
2016-05-24 	Richard Forth   Changed the way it handles nothing at all 
				listening on port 80. It now falls back
				to the process list as if somehing WAS
				listening on port 80 that was NOT apache.
2016-05-20 	Richard Forth   Fixed a bug with parent pid detected,
				reported by J. Ramsey - with thanks! 
2016-03-03 	Richard Forth   Added MD5Sums + News Item. 
2016-02-27 	Richard Forth   Added code to display verbose memory
				usage information, and then bug out with a 
				critical error if ram is overbooked, before
				we even start (ie no ram left for apache)
2016-02-27 	Richard Forth   Added code to display verbose memory usage
				information, prior to calculations, as I was
				trying to solve the mystery of negative
				percentages. Found that if ram is over booked,
				this skews the results massively.
2016-02-24 	Richard Forth   Added code to display MaxRequestsPerChild
				information (prefork mode) 
2016-02-24 	Richard Forth   Fixed bug out code in preflight checks if
				apache parent is greater than 50MB, as 
				I was notified that this wasnt working on
				ubuntu 12.04 systems.
2016-02-16 	Richard Forth   Added bug out code in preflight checks if
				apache parent is greater than 50MB, as 
				this skews results and calculations.
2015-10-18 	Richard Forth   Fixed some logic in the Results section. 
2015-10-18 	Richard Forth   Dropped "new and improved!!!" from the logo.
				Updated the news items. 
2015-10-03 	Richard Forth   Changed Recommendations based on an actual
				valid range (10% of max). Previously anything
				below the maximim was considered accpetable. 
				Now there is a minimum (Max / .90) and Max,
				which is reported in the recommendations.
2015-10-03 	Richard Forth   Changed layout of memory report, as requested
				by Luke H.
2015-10-03 	Richard Forth   Added detection for if maxClients or
				MaxRequestWorkers has been hit. 
2015-09-25 	Richard Forth   Added Apache current memory consumption to
				'Analysing apache memory usage' section. 
2015-09-23 	Richard Forth   Added Gluster Memory Detection 
				- Feature Request from P. Steyn
2015-09-08 	Richard Forth   Minor Cosmetic Changes and Spelling Corrections
				Removed --PHP option, and included 
				PHP Memory Limit in Discoveries.
2015-09-03 	Richard Forth   Minor Cosmetic Changes and Spelling Corrections.
2015-08-21 	Richard Forth   Minor Bug Fix - Lines 1497 and 1498 added.
2015-08-06 	Richard Forth	Improvement to code.
2015-08-06 	Richard Forth	K. Geaney Reported a bug whereby the script
				would detect itself in the processlist
				apache2 portion of the script name 
				apache2buddy.pl is picked up when the script
				is wgetted and run locally rather than with
				curl & perl.
				Added a filter (grep -v "buddy") to prevent this
				happening in the future.
2015-08-03 	Richard Forth	L. Hanley Reported a bug whereby the script
				would error if the apache process was 
				running as a user that had more than 8 
				characters. This has been fixed now.
2015-06-06 	Richard Forth	G. John reported a bug whereby if a server
				has a certain character set, the apache
				user is shown as 'apache\x{d}' rather than 
				'apache', which causes the ps aux line
				to produce and empty data set which is passed
				to pmap resulting in a division by
				zero error, this was also present in the
				maxclients and serverlimit variables.
				
				To fix that I added the following lines of code
				in various places in the script:

				          # account for 'apache\x{d}' strangeness
				          $variable =~ s/\x{d}//;

				What this does is replace the control characters
				that cause this issue, preventing the script from
				producing a list of PIDs. Better error handling if
				the list of PIDs are still zero.
				Where $variable name was one of $apache_user, 
				$maxclients, or	$serverlimit.
2015-06-03 	Richard Forth	Switched the IP provider from curlmyip.com to 
				myip.dnsomatic.com as curlmyip	was becoming very
				slow to respond, causing unnecessary lag.
2015-05-27 	Richard Forth	Removed last 5 log entries from output
				if --report or --noinfo is specified. 
2015-05-27 	Richard Forth	Removed calculations of maxclients for 
				worker processes. Instead, I left a 
				friendly message to go check manually for 
				backend processes such as PHP-FPM
				and its pm.max_children directive. 
				There is no plan to add functionality to
				check this, as it will become a scope creep.
2015-05-27 	Richard Forth	Bug Fix reported by C. Piper-Balta in which 
				the script would produce errors if
				the process name was /usr/sbin/httpd.worker
				or /usr/sbin/nginx. The test_process
				subroutine had some flawed logic which has
				been fixed now.
2015-04-23 	Richard Forth	Bug Fixes when selecting --lightbg / -L,
				not all colours were made bold.
2015-04-23 	Richard Forth	Bug Fixes when falling back to process list,
				now picks up the correct port.
2015-04-23 	Richard Forth	Minor cosmetic changes.
2015-04-23 	Richard Forth	Added more graceful operation if Varnish is
				found on port 80 instead of apache, it
				now is able to go away and find out what 
				port apache is really listening on, eg 
				port 8080, and reset itself to go ahead and 
				continue the scan on the new port.
2015-04-17 	Richard Forth	Added support for RHEL 7 / Apache 2.4
2015-04-17 	Richard Forth	Added support for CentOS 7 / Apache 2.4
2015-04-17 	Richard Forth	Minor bugfixes, made enhancements to reporting, 
				cleaned up the news items..

				returns, nothing major.

2015-04-15 	Richard Forth	Corrected an error on Ubuntu systems where it 
				would incorrectly suggest that 'worker' was not 
				a supported MPM, it is, because sometimes people 
				will use worker when using php-fpm. 'event' 
				however is not supported, but I added a
				nice helpful message if event MPM is detected on 
				how to switch to a supported MPM. 
2015-04-15 	Richard Forth	Added better error-handling for missing php package
				on ubuntu and prints a	helpful message.

2015-04-14 	Richard Forth	Added MPM to report section.
2015-04-13 	Richard Forth	Added hostname and IP address to report section, 
				this makes a lot of sense. If we're looping through 
				a server farm we need toidentify each one, right?
2015-04-13 	Richard Forth	Split "Analysing your memory usage" into 2 sections, 
				the second section is called "Results".

2015-04-12 	Richard Forth	Converting large blocks of print statements
				into heredocs, to shave off more deadweight.
				Usage done so far.
2015-04-12 	Richard Forth	Fixed a bug where it would display warnings
				about ThreadsPerChild regardless of the model, 
				I made it so it only displays the warning if 
				indeed the current model is worker.
2015-04-12 	Richard Forth	- added --report|r option, awaiting feedback.
