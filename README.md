# domain

apache2buddy.pl is a polish domain which happens to be the extension of perl scripts, so registered it and pointed it here:

apache2buddy.pl => https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardforth/apache2buddy/master/apache2buddy.pl

This allows one to execute it on the server easily with

	# curl -sL apache2buddy.pl | perl

Notes on the curl & perl method:

	-s      silent (dont show the curl download header)
	-L      follow redirects (very important as you get a 301)

You can also wget it but this is frowned upon (especially by me) however you can do it like so:

	# cd
	# wget -O apache2buddy.pl apache2buddy.pl
	# perl apache2buddy.pl

Reasons I frown when you do this wget method:

	1. Youre downloading the file. This file is never going to get updated, unless you wget it again.
	2. I do regular bugfixes, feature requestss and cleanups of code.
	3. With curl and perl, you always pull the latest version.

# apache2buddy

If any changes are made please update the md5sums and sha256sums or some automation fails:

        # md5sum apache2buddy.pl > md5sums.txt
        # sha256sum apache2buddy.pl > sha256sums.txt
        
# Best Practice
        
Best Practice is to check the code against either the md5sums or sha256sums (or both) before execution of the code.

Example:

        --- a2bchk.sh ---
        #!/bin/bash
        # example of testing md5sums prior to execution

        # apache has its own domain 'apache2buddy.pl' this saves typing out 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardforth/apache2buddy/master/apache2buddy.pl'
        scriptmd5sum=`curl -sL apache2buddy.pl | md5sum | cut -d " " -f1`
        originmd5sum=`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardforth/apache2buddy/master/md5sums.txt | cut -d " " -f1`
        echo $scriptmd5sum
        echo $originmd5sum
        if [ $scriptmd5sum == $originmd5sum ]
        then
                scriptsha256sum=`curl -sL apache2buddy.pl | sha256sum | cut -d " " -f1`
                originsha256sum=`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardforth/apache2buddy/master/sha256sums.txt | cut -d " " -f1`
                echo $scriptsha256sum
                echo $originsha256sum
                if [ $scriptsha256sum == $originsha256sum ]
                then
                        # execute the code, its safe - we can assume
                        curl -sL apache2buddy.pl | perl
                else
                        echo "Error: SHA256SUM mismatch, execution aborted."
                fi
        else
                echo "Error: MD5SUM mismatch, execution aborted."
        fi
        --- end a2bchk.sh ---



If the md5sums or sha256sums do not match, then changes have been made and its untested, so do not proceed until they match.

# Special Note

Even if the md5sums and sha256sums match, remember youre still running arbitrary code on YOUR SERVER, AS ROOT, thats quite a dangerous proposition, so please do check the code, its YOUR responsibilty to make sure this doesnt break your systems, run it in a test environment first, sandbox it, test it thoroughly before you run it on your live systems, PLEASE!, I beg you!

# Risk Factors

- Running arbitrary code as root (Dangerous)
- Compromised script could result in root level compromise of your server
- Runaway processes doing not what they are supposed to (this actually happened in testing, thankfully all of the known exceptions have been caught)

# The apache2buddy.pl domain

This tool has its own domain, that redirects to the raw script in the master branch:

        apache2buddy.pl => https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardforth/apache2buddy/master/apache2buddy.pl

Be sure to specify the -L switch when curling and perling.

# About, and heritage information

apache2buddy.pl is a reporting tool and onetime run dashboard for assisting with tuning and troubleshooting apache webservers.

        # curl -sL apache2buddy.pl | perl

It is a fork of the original project 'apachebuddy.pl'.

        # curl -sL apachebuddy.pl | perl

Its' continued development has included support for Debian and Ubuntu, wherease the original script only used to suport RedHat / CentOS Systems 

New features have been added and if you compared the two outputs above you will notice a vastly more intuitive and informational dash:

        #

So as you may see, there are some similarities between the new and the old, but the NEW has undergone some incerdible changes and is an entirely new beast, one of the most killer featues is that it nows takes into consideration a nuumber of services BEFORE calculating a maxcients value, this includes:

       - MySQL
       - Java
       - Varnish
       - Redis
       - Memcache
       - PHP-FPM
       - Gluster


# Logging

On every execution, an entry is made in a log file: /var/log/apache2buddy.log on your server.

Example log line:

        2016/05/24 10:14:15 Model: "Prefork" Memory: "490 MB" Maxclients: "50" Recommended: "54" Smallest: "8.49 MB" Avg: "8.49 MB" Largest: "8.49 MB" Highest Pct Remaining RAM: "91.84%" (86.64% TOTAL RAM)


This is to help you get an idea of changes over time to your apache tuning requirements. Maybe this will help you decide when you need more RAM, or when you need to start streamlining your code. Tracking when performace started degrading.

Remember it only puts a new entry in the log file on each new execution. Its not designed to be run as a cron job or anything.

# Log Rotation

Log rotation should not be necessary because this script is NOT designed to be run as a cron job so it should never really fill your disks, if you ran this on your server a year or six months ago, maybe its just nice to see what the results were from back then? You get the idea.
